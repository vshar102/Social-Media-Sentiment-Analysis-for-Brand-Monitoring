🎯 Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution that transforms manual social media monitoring into an automated, data-driven system. Using advanced NLP techniques with spaCy and machine learning, it provides real-time sentiment classification and business intelligence for brand management.
Purpose

Automate sentiment classification of social media posts (tweets)
Reduce manual monitoring time through intelligent automation
Enable proactive brand management with early warning systems
Provide actionable insights for marketing and customer engagement strategies

Target Outcome
Build a production-ready sentiment analysis system that achieves reasonable accuracy in classifying social media sentiment while delivering immediate business value through automated monitoring and alerting.

🎯 Business Problem
Challenge
Organizations struggle with manual social media sentiment monitoring which is:

Time-intensive and unscalable with growing social media volume
Subjective and inconsistent across different human analysts
Reactive rather than proactive in identifying reputation risks
Limited in generating actionable insights for business decisions

Key Questions to Answer

How can we automatically classify sentiment of social media posts?
What are the predominant sentiment patterns over time?
Can we identify early warning signals for potential PR crises?
Which topics or keywords correlate with negative sentiment spikes?
